The `Updates` API from **`expo`** allows you to programmatically control and respond to over-the-air updates to your app.

<PlatformsSection android emulator ios simulator />

## Installation

<InstallSection packageName="expo-updates" />

Since extra setup is required to use this module in bare React Native apps, for easiest use we recommend using a template project with `expo-updates` already installed. You can use `expo init --template=expo-template-bare-minimum` to initialize a new project from such a template.

> Most of the methods and constants in this module can only be used or tested in release mode; they do not make sense in debug builds where you always load the latest JS from your computer while developing. To test manual updates in the Expo Go app, run `expo publish` and then open the published version of your app with Expo Go. To test manual updates in Bare workflow apps, make a release build with `npm run ios --configuration Release` or `npm run android --variant Release` (you don't need to submit this build to the App/Play Store to test).

## API

```js
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';
```

<APISection packageName="expo-updates" apiName="Updates" />
